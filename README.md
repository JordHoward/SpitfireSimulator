# SpitfireSimulator
This is a repo where all code and CAD files for my Supermarine Spitfire MK.IX are stored. Feel free to use any of the files.

# Project Overview
I'm (slowly) building a Supermarine Spitfire MK.IX simulator. I'm using DCS World as the base simulator and then the Skunkworks fork of DCS-BIOS to communicate with the game. From there I'm currently using Arduino's to control various switches and dials.


# Dependancies
This repo uses the Skunkworks fork of DCS-BIOS (https://github.com/DCS-Skunkworks/dcs-bios?tab=readme-ov-file)
